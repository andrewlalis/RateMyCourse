# RateMyCourse
For too long, students have had to rely on word-of-mouth to gain valuable insight into their upcoming classes. At **RateMyCourse**, we plan to change that. By providing a clean, easy-to-use interface for students to both leave reviews and read others', our goal is to improve transparency in universities and shine a light on *exemplary* courses, as well as those that are lacking.
